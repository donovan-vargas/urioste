# Backend developer position challenge

## Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone `git@github.com:donovan-vargas/urioste.git`
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ make
```
Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```sh
bash server-wrapper.sh
```
